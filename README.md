# FinPort - Financial Portfolio App

## Project Overview

FinPort is a React Native mobile application designed to help users track their investments across multiple financial markets, including NASDAQ, BIST, cryptocurrency, and gold prices. The app offers personalized portfolio views, real-time market data fetched via the Finnhub API, and user authentication through Firebase.

This project was developed during my summer internship at Fintag Yazılım Danışmanlık A.Ş., aiming to enhance my skills in JavaScript, React Native, and cloud services like Firebase.
